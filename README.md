# Installation Steps

#### 1) Create a VPS

  - TEAM EGEM Referral links:

    **Vultr: [`https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7408289`](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7408289)**

    **Linode: [`https://www.linode.com/?r=0543b2c292a0dcae51ac3fea3d7f170d956565c3`](https://www.linode.com/?r=0543b2c292a0dcae51ac3fea3d7f170d956565c3)**

#### 2) Get console access to your VPS

  - Use console/terminal or a tool like **[`Putty`](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)**

  - Login directly as **`root`**

    **IMPORTANT NOTE:**

    If you need to work on a non-root user, you must run **`sudo -s`** first, otherwise setup might not work properly

#### 3) Run the following command on your VPS console to install Docker + Egem node
To install both Docker and the Egem node image execute the following command:
  > **`bash -c "$(curl -ko - https://github.com/luisvi70/docker-install/raw/master/nodemanager)"`**

  or use this one if your system doesn't have **`curl`** installed:

  > **`bash -c "$(wget --no-check-certificate -O - https://github.com/luisvi70/docker-install/raw/master/nodemanager)"`**

#### If Docker already installed in Host, then just install Egem node
If you have already installed docker in your system, then you just need to get
the docker Egem node image. Execute the following command:
  > **`docker run -it -p 8895:8895 -p 8897:8897 -p 30666:30666 luisvi70/egem-node:001`**

# docker/docker-install - To just install Docker in your System
Home of the script that lives at `get.docker.com` and `test.docker.com`!

The purpose of the install script is for a convenience for quickly
installing the latest Docker-CE releases on the supported linux
distros. It is not recommended to depend on this script for deployment
to production systems. For more thorough instructions for installing
on the supported distros, see the [install
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
